Statement on dissemination of data: The QJE strongly urges authors to make their data
available for public use, and the QJE web site can be used for this purpose. This availability is
important for replication and extension of research findings. We also recognize that good incentives for generating and assembling data entail an interval of private use and that sometimes
this private use extends beyond the first application of the data in an initial article. However,
in the longer run, the creator of a data set is also benefited by wide dissemination use, and citation of the data that have been generated.
