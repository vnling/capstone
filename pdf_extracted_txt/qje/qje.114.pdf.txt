ANNOUNCEMENT

This issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics marks the
retirement of Olivier Blanchard and Andrei Shleifer from their

service as editors. The new editorial board (Alberto Alesina,
Edward Glaeser, and Lawrence Katz, who is continuing as editor)

would like to pay tribute to the work of these two exceptional
editors. Over the space of fourteen and ten years, respectively,
Blanchard and Shleifer have set a standard for judicious and
energetic editing that will be extremely difficult to replace. These
two have been a critical part of the superb team of editors who
have made the QJE into the second most cited journal per article
in economics (after the Journal of Economic Literature). Most
importantly, Blanchard and Shleifer have displayed an intellec-

tual courage that the new editorial board wishes to emulate.
These editors pushed the Journal away from "safe" papers
on established topics toward bolder, riskier work that extends

the boundaries of economics. We salute Andrei and Olivier for
their wisdom, their effort, their intellectual honesty, and their
bravery. We will do our best to ensure that the Journal continues
to embody their spirit of intellectual discovery and scholarly
excellence.
