Statement on dissemination of data: The QJE strongly urges authors to make their data
available for public use, and the QJE web site can be used for this purpose. This availability
is important for replication and extension of research findings. We also recognize that good
incentives for generating and assembling data entail an interval of private use and that
sometimes this private use extends beyond the first application of the data in an initial article.

However, in the longer run, the creator of a data set is also benefited by wide dissemination
use, and citation of the data that have been generated.

Acknowledgement
This issue marks the retirement of Harriet Hoffman, who has been

the assistant editor of the journal for 33 years. Harriet has spent an
enormous amount of her life making the Quarterly Journal of Econom

ics a better journal. She has managed the submission and editorial
process. She has edited over a thousand papers, improving writing and
maintaining the QJE style. She has contributed significantly to the
QJE's most famous papers from Akerlof s market for lemons to Dono
hue and Levitt's abortion and crime and received little of the glory. It
is appropriate that we thank her now.
Harriet's most important contributions came at the editing stage,
where she went word-by-word and figure-by-figure through every ar
ticle. She catches errors and enforces style, but also guards the English
language from abuse at the hands of less than literary economists.
When academics write papers, they do so in the expectation of recog
nition and the hope of lasting fame. Harriet edited those same papers
with none of the same rewards and did a terrific job.

The economists who have edited the journal have occasionally

been models of administrative competence but have sometimes been
less well organized. Harriet has managed to steer the journal through
all of them with equanimity. Her ability to put up with us is itself an
accomplishment.
On a personal level, Harriet has become known particularly for
her passion for New England's avian population. The one thing that
the editors feared might bring the journal to a halt was another
sighting of a Ross Gull in New England. While the journal is saddened
to lose Harriet's contributions, we are at least sure that our loss will be

a gain to the birding population. Harriet gave much to the Quarterly
Journal of Economics and she will be greatly missed.
