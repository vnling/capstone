ANNOUNCEMENT

To commemorate the end of one century and the beginning of
another, the Board of Editors of the Quarterly Journal of Economics invited a select group of distinguished economists to submit
articles assessing the accomplishments of the discipline of economics in the twentieth century. We have asked each of these scholars

to reflect on "what we know that Marshall did not" in different
areas of economics. The first of these contributions (by William
Baumol, James Heckman, and Edward Lazear) appears in this
issue of the Quarterly Journal of Economics. The others will
appear later in this calendar year in the Quarterly Journal of
Economics. The Board of Editors is extremely grateful to Claudia
Goldin and Andrei Shleifer for their help in editing these contributions on economics and the twentieth century.

The Griliches Prize in Empirical Economics

Harvard University and the University of Chicago announce
the establishment of the Griliches Prize in Empirical Economics.
The purpose of this prize is to recognize outstanding empirical
work in the spirit of Zvi Griliches' contributions.
The prize will be awarded every two years to a paper that
contributes significantly to our understanding of a substantive

question. A major component of the paper should be the presentation of new empirical findings or new methods that advance the
struggle with measurement issues.
Papers eligible for the Griliches Prize will alternate between

those published in the Journal of Political Economy and those
published in the Quarterly Journal of Economics. Papers remain

eligible for four years. Thus, the first award will be given in
August 2000 to a paper published since 1996 in the QJE, the

second will be given in June 2002 to a paper published since 1998
in the JPE, and so on.

A prize committee of distinguished economists appointed by
the chairs of the economics departments at the University of
Chicago and Harvard University will choose the winning paper.

The prize will consist of a monetary award of $2000, to be split
evenly among coauthors. The National Bureau of Economic
Research will manage the fund and make payments.
