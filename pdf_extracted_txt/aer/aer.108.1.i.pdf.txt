It is the policy of the American Economic Review to publish papers only if the data used in the
analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for
purposes of replication. Details of the computations sufficient to permit replication must be
provided. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper
are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.
