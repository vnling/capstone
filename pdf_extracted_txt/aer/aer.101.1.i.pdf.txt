Information on how to submit a manuscript is available online:
http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/submissions.php
It is the policy of The American Economic Review to publish papers only if the data used in
the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher
for purposes of replication. Details of the computations sufficient to permit replication must
be provided. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper
are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

American Economic Review 101 (February 2011): i–ii
http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.101.1.i

T

he first issue of the American Economic Review appeared in 1911.
To celebrate the Centenary of the Review, this issue contains six
special articles. The first is a report which selects the top 20 articles
in the history of the journal, selected by a committee composed of
Kenneth J. Arrow, B. Douglas Bernheim, Martin S. Feldstein, Daniel L.
McFadden, James M. Poterba, and Robert M. Solow (chair). The second is a history of the Review by Robert A. Margo. The third is a reprint
of the first article in the AER, by Katharine Coman on problems of
irrigation (a special case of the commons problem), followed by commentaries by Gary D. Libecap, Elinor Ostrom, and Robert N. Stavins.
I would like to thank the members of the Top 20 committee and the
authors of the other papers for their work in preparing their materials. In
addition, I would like to thank Avinash Dixit for the inspiration for the
Top 20 concept, Regina Montgomery for the idea of reprinting the first
paper in the Review with commentaries, and John Siegfried for his customary wise counsel and sage advice throughout the planning process.
Robert A. Moffitt, Editor,
2004–2010
