Information on how to submit a manuscript is available online:
http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/submissions.html
It is the policy of the American Economic Review to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly

and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication. Details of the

computations sufficient to permit replication must be provided. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission
if the data used in a paper are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.

The June 2004 issue of the American Economic Review includes an article by Frijters, Haisken-DeNew, and Shields
titled "Money Does Matter! Evidence from Increasing Real Income and Life Satisfaction in East Germany Following
Reunification." This article is similar in content to a paper by the same authors published in the Summer 2004 issue
of the Journal of Human Resources. Authors submitting papers to this journal are reminded that all prior work and
its relationship to the paper being submitted should be fully described.

BEN S. BERNANKE

EDITOR, AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW, 2001-2004

The American Economic Association and its membership express profoun
gratitude to Ben Bernanke for the service he provided to the profession duri
his three-year term as Editor of the American Economic Review.
With Ben at the helm, the AER moved forward in several important way
He introduced an electronic, Web-based management system that has mad
the processing of manuscripts more efficient and easier to access by both
authors and referees, and has permitted the Association to consolidate its
journal publication offices in Pittsburgh, bringing about considerable cost
reductions. He oversaw the expansion by over 15 percent of the number o
pages in AER issues, thereby increasing the number of articles that could
accepted. Turnaround time at the AER was reduced under Ben's stewardsh
another result of his diligence. And while he was editor, the AER grew in
popularity as an outlet for research, experiencing a 30-percent increase in t

rate of submissions.

Ben accomplished all these tasks while serving, for much of his AER term,

on the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Bank-a remarkable
achievement.

Above all, Ben's good judgment and high standards served to maintain the
superior quality of the articles published in the AER, which continues to
represent the best scholarship in the discipline. The membership and the
profession are deeply indebted to Ben Bernanke for his distinguished service
as Editor of the American Economic Review from 2001 to 2004.
