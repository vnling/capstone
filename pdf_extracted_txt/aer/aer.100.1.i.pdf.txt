Information on how to submit a manuscript is available online:
http://www.aeaweb.org/aer/submissions.php
It is the policy of The American Economic Review to publish papers only if the data used in
the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher
for purposes of replication. Details of the computations sufficient to permit replication must
be provided. The Editor should be notified at the time of submission if the data used in a paper
are proprietary or if, for some other reason, the requirements above cannot be met.
