Editorial Announcement
ANTONI CALVO-ARMENGOL

It is with great sorrow that we record the unexpected death in November 2007
our editorial board member Antoni Calv6-Armengol at the age of 37. Apart from

tremendous personal loss to his wife and young children, other family, colleagu
and friends, this is a great loss to the economics community in general, and to

Review of Economic Studies in particular. He was an outstanding researcher (co
cidentally, one of his papers is published in this issue) and a warm and enthusias
friend to many of us. We shall not be able to replace him.
