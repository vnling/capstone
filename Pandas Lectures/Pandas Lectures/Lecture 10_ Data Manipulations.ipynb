The index is essentially a row level label, and in pandas the rows correspond to axis zero. \n","\n","Indices can be either autogenerated, such as when we create a new Series without an index, in which case we get numeric values, or they can be set explicitly, like when we use the dictionary object to create the series, or when we loaded data from the CSV file and set appropriate parameters. Another option for setting an index is to use the `set_index()` function. This function takes a list of columns and promotes those columns to an index. In this lecture we'll explore more about how indexes work in pandas.\n","\n","**Important note: the `set_index()` function is a destructive process that doesn't keep the current index. If you want to keep the current index, you need to manually create a new column and copy into it values from the index attribute.**\n","\n","Let's import pandas and our admissions dataset.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"7mO1M9gAB2P3","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632907013986,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":1352,"user":{"displayName":"Bedoor AlShebli","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GidDz9yYOu5OF7H8uFOwHv13QhCL-uS3bC2RbvY=s64","userId":"16007664423560638977"}},"outputId":"b994062f-6144-43cf-a489-603eca9e2a93"},"source":["# Again, to access the file, you need to mount the drive. \n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')\n","#!ls /content/drive/My\\ Drive/Applied\\ Data\\ Science\\ in\\ Python/datasets/  # Running a line with a \"!\" in the start is identical to running a bash script"],"execution_count":115,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Xi_20iF68uBG","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":234},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632907286655,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":315,"user":{"displayName":"Bedoor AlShebli","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GidDz9yYOu5OF7H8uFOwHv13QhCL-uS3bC2RbvY=s64","userId":"16007664423560638977"}},"outputId":"5d60481e-f25f-494b-a462-5a3ad44f889e"},"source":["import pandas as pd\n","\n","df = pd.read_csv(\"/content/drive/My Drive/Applied Data Science in Python/datasets/Admission_Predict.csv\", index_col=\"Serial No.\")\n","\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":116,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>GRE Score</th>\n","      <th>TOEFL Score</th>\n","      <th>University Rating</th>\n","      <th>SOP</th>\n","      <th>LOR</th>\n","      <th>CGPA</th>\n","      <th>Research</th>\n","      <th>Chance of Admit</th>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>Serial No.</th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th></th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>337</td>\n","      <td>118</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>4.5</td>\n","      <td>4.5</td>\n","      <td>9.65</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.92</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>324</td>\n","      <td>107</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>4.0</td>\n","      <td>4.5</td>\n","      <td>8.87</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.76</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>316</td>\n","      <td>104</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>3.5</td>\n","      <td>8.00</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.72</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>322</td>\n","      <td>110</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>3.5</td>\n","      <td>2.5</td>\n","      <td>8.67</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.80</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>5</th>\n","      <td>314</td>\n","      <td>103</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>2.0</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>8.21</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.65</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["            GRE Score  TOEFL Score  ...

Missing values are pretty common in data cleaning activities, and can be there for any number of\n","reasons. Here are a few of those reasons:\n","\n","1. For instance, if you are running a survey and a respondant didn't answer a question, the missing value is actually an omission. This kind of missing data is called **Missing at Random** if there are other variables that might be used to predict the variable which is missing. For example, when working on surveys I often find that missing data, say the interest in being involved in a follow up study, often has some correlation with another data field, like gender or ethnicity. \n","\n","2. If there is no relationship to other variables, then we call this data **Missing Completely at Random (MCAR)**.\n","\n","3. Finally, data might be missing because it wasn't collected, either by the process responsible for collecting that data, such as a researcher, or because it wouldn't make sense if it were collected. \n","\n","This last example is extremely common when you start joining DataFrames together from multiple sources, such as joining a list of people at a university with a list of offices in the university (students generally don't have offices).\n","\n","Let's look at some ways of handling missing data in pandas."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ar3tdnXwvnme"},"source":["# Let's import pandas\n","import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZWvnF5GCVsxk"},"source":["Pandas is pretty good at detecting missing values directly from underlying data formats, like CSV files. Although most missing values are often formatted as `NaN`, `NULL`, `None`, or `N/A`, sometimes missing values are not labeled so clearly. For example, I've worked with social scientists who regularly used the value of `99` in binary categories to indicate a missing value. The pandas `read_csv()` function has a parameter called `na_values` to let us specify the form of missing values.

You should know that concatenation also has inner and outer methods. If you are concatenating two dataframes that do not have identical columns, and choose the outer method, some cells will be `NaN`. If you choose to do inner, then some observations will be dropped due to `NaN` values. You can think of this as analogous to the left and right joins of the `merge()` function.\n","\n","Now you know how to merge and concatenate datasets together. You will find such functions very useful for combining data needed to do more complex analysis. A solid understanding of how to merge data is absolutely essential when you are procuring, cleaning, and manipulating data. It's worth knowing how to merge different datasets quickly, and the different options you can use when merging datasets, and I would encourage you to check out the pandas docs for merging and concatenating data."]}]}
